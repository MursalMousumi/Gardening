About 1-2 inches of water are required per week. Use drip irrigation if possible to conserve water. Applying mulch around the plant also helps conserve soil moisture and reduce weed growth. Moisture fluctuations during heading will cause maturing sprouts to split open or develop bitter flavors."],
    "cabbage":['Cabbage', 'cabbage.jpg', "Water your cabbage once a week, applying 1 1/2 inches of water to the soil. If the soil is dry to a depth of 3 inches, water more frequently. Water in the morning to avoid water sitting on the plant's leaves, which encourages pests and diseases."],

    "eggplant": ['Eggplant', 'eggplant.jpg', 'Water eggplant deeply and infrequently, applying 1-2 inches per week. Use drip irrigation if possible. Mulching around the plant will conserve soil moisture and reduce weed growth. Irrigate so that moisture goes deeply into the soil.'],
    "hotPepper": ['Hot Peppers', 'hotPepper.jpg', 'Deeply water the plants with 1 inch of water per week, and adjust the amount or frequency during hot, dry periods, after rainfall or if your soil is sandy and drains fast.'],
